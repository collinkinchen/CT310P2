vanilla,"Wikimedia, <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vanilla_chamissonis_habitat.JPG"">Vanilla chamissonis habitat</a>","Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). The word vanilla, derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as ""little pod"". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlilxochitl by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.","<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla"">Vanilla</a>. Wikipedia.
