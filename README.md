# CT310P2
Project 2 for Ct310

Updated ingredients.php so it can show ingredients based on the value of $ingredient, defaulted to vanilla. 
Will need functions that displays picture source, description and description cource based on the name of ingredient.
I put all the images in assets/img and the style sheet to assets/css, and updated the corresponding phps.
