# CT310P2
Project 2 for Ct310<br/>

Updated ingredients.php so it can show ingredients based on the value of $ingredient, defaulted to vanilla. <br/>
Will need functions that displays picture source, description and description cource based on the name of ingredient.<br/>
I put all the images in assets/img and the style sheet to assets/css, and updated the corresponding phps. <br/>
Homepage.php and ingredients.php got updated. The ingredients page now works ok. <br/>
